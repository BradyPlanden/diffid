# Getting Started with Diffid

Welcome to Diffid! This section will help you get up and running with time-series inference and optimisation.

## Learning Path

We recommend following this sequence:

1. **[Installation](installation.md)** - Platform-specific installation instructions and troubleshooting
2. **[5-Minute Quickstart](quickstart.md)** - Simple scalar optimisation with the Rosenbrock function
3. **[First ODE Fit](first-ode-fit.md)** - Fitting differential equations to data with DiffSL
4. **[Core Concepts](concepts.md)** - Understanding builders, problems, and the ask/tell pattern

## Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.11
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with NumPy arrays (helpful but not required)
- For ODE fitting: basic knowledge of differential equations

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Install Diffid on your platform
- Create and solve scalar optimisation problems
- Fit differential equations to experimental data
- Understand the builder pattern and problem types
- Choose between optimisers and samplers for your use case
