# Dynamic Nested Sampling Algorithm

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    Sampler documentation is being written.

## Overview

Dynamic Nested Sampling calculates model evidence (marginal likelihood) for Bayesian model comparison.

## When to Use

**Best for:**

- Model comparison
- Calculating Bayes factors
- Evidence calculation
- Multi-modal posteriors

**Avoid when:**

- Only need posterior samples (use MCMC)
- Limited computational budget

## API Reference

See [Samplers API](../../api-reference/python/samplers.md) for usage details (coming soon).
